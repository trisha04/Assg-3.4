NameNode importance in HADOOP Cluster:
It is thew major piece of HDFS file system
Stores the metadata of all the nodes
It also maintains the directory tree of files in a file system
Keeps a track of the location of file in a cluster
Nmaenode is called as the masternode and it does not store data of all the slave nodes
It knows how to construuct file from blocks.
Nmaenode was a single point of failure on Hadoop 1.x and hadoop cluster was considered down
In Hadoop 2.x a secondary namenode is present whic hacts as abackup node to provide high data availability
When namenode goes down,secondary namenode becomes active
